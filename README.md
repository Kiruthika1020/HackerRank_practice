Kiruthika's HackerRank Practice

This repository contains my practice programs from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).  
I'm currently solving beginner-level challenges to build strong coding fundamentals.

Folder Overview:

I'm solving the **same problem** in:

- ✅ C#
- ✅ Java
- ✅ Python

This helps me understand the logic in different languages and compare the syntax.

Right now, I’ve added 3 beginner-level problems in each folder.  
I’ll keep learning and updating this repo as I grow!

Thanks for visiting 😊
